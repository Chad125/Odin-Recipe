        <p>Patato Latkes also known as potato pancakes with a side of apple sauce, I know apple sauce as a side sounds super weird but trust me you wont 
            want it any other way after trying it. The apple sauce adds the perfect amount of sweetness and really ties this dish together. This recipe
            makes 6 servings.</p>
